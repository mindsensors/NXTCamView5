The MicroPython language
========================

MicroPython aims to implement the Python 3.4 standard, and most of
the features of MicroPython are identical to those described by the
documentation at
`docs.python.org <http://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/index.html>`_.

Differences to standard Python as well as additional features of
MicroPython are described in the sections here.
